    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Canada uses many environmental policies to protect nature, reduce pollution, and prepare for climate change. This website explains some key examples and their impact.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Carbon Pricing</strong> – Putting a cost on pollution to reduce emissions.</li>
      <li><strong>Single-Use Plastic Ban</strong> – Banning items like plastic straws and bags.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean Energy Support</strong> – Funding wind, solar, and hydro power.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Some policies face pushback from industries, and some areas still rely on fossil fuels. There's also a need for stronger enforcement in certain regions.</p>

    <h2>How AI Helps Environmental Policies</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being used more and more to support environmental policies in Canada and around the world. AI tools are helping governments and environmental agencies collect data, make better decisions, and take faster action to protect nature and fight climate change.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Climate Prediction:</strong> AI can study huge amounts of climate data to predict things like temperature changes, extreme weather, and pollution levels. This helps the government make better climate plans.</li>

      <li><strong>Pollution Detection:</strong> AI systems can find air and water pollution using smart sensors and satellite images. This helps catch problems early and fix them faster.</li>

      <li><strong>Forest and Wildlife Protection:</strong> Drones and cameras powered by AI can watch forests and animal habitats. They can detect illegal logging or poaching and alert officials quickly.</li>

      <li><strong>Smart Energy Use:</strong> AI helps manage electricity in homes and cities. It reduces energy waste and supports Canada’s clean energy goals, like using wind and solar power.</li>

      <li><strong>Testing Environmental Policies:</strong> AI models can simulate new environmental policies before they are used. This helps governments see what works best without risking real-world problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In short, AI helps make environmental policies smarter, faster, and more effective. It allows Canada to protect the environment better and plan for a greener future.
